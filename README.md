University Project for Database Management - course of Computer Engineering at University of Minho.

## So, what is this?
System that monotorizes an Oracle database by showing different parameters such has information about datafiles, memory, tablespaces, users, sessions, cpu, etc.

This was made by creating an agent in Java that, by acessing administrator views and tables, collects the desired data and fills a new database which will be used to transform
the data in a JSON format which will be posted to a website where we can monitor everything.
